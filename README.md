# This repository is a archive
This repository is an archive that I made by forking the original repository, according to the original creator (Dr Ocelot) she abandoned the Project due to several code and design problems that can be easy to find (or not), the original game is still online, I can even continue the project adding several things etc, since it is open source, the problem is that most of the things may need to be removed and others to be fixed, I just hope you get the chance to try programming CSS, HTML5 or whatever this game uses and make a spiritual sequel to the original.  Currently this is a problem for me 

# The Problems
1- The languages used 
 > Tetra Legends uses CSS, HTML5 and JS but I'm only familiar with Python, GDScript and BDScript and how i acostumed It might take me a while to get used to it 


2- My actual State
> I literally have personal and school problems actually, and im foucused on a own game (no a tetris-like),

3- Coding 
 > the lines of code are really a mess according to Ocelot, I haven't really looked but if it's really messy it must really be a headache

# Conclusion 

I may be making a spiritual sequel (not official of course) but I'm not interested at the moment, I just forked it to archive the repository in case the original goes down or goes offline. 

Tetra Legends Original is still on air if you want check: https://tetralegends.app
