# This repository is a archive
This repository is an archive that I made by forking the original repository, according to the original creator (Dr Ocelot) she abandoned the Project due to several code and design problems that can be easy to find (or not), the original game is still online, I can even continue the project adding several things etc, since it is open source, the problem is that most of the things may need to be removed and others to be fixed, I just hope you get the chance to try programming CSS, HTML5 or whatever this game uses and make a spiritual sequel to the original.  Currently this is a problem for me 

# The Problems
1- The languages used 



2- My actual State
